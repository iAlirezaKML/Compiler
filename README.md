# Compiler
Compiler for almost any CFG-Compatible Language

This is an academic project which contains `Lexical Analysis` and `Parser` for given DFA & CFG (BNF Representation of a Language).


You can get the DFA with this tool: http://hackingoff.com/compilers/scanner-generator

# Sample
There is a `Sample` folder corresponding to these projects, which can clarify usage of this program.
For `Lexer`, you have to declare your DFA and Patterns inside `DFA.cpp` and place `source.swift` alongside compiled binary.
Also for `Parser`, you need to provide `token.txt` and `grammar.txt` as Input files alongside compiled binary.
